Fetch API - Used for making network requests to fetch events data from a mock API, enabling asynchronous communication with backend services.
CSS - For styling the application, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
Jest - Utilized for writing unit tests to ensure the reliability and robustness of the application's components and logic.
ESLint - A linting tool used to maintain code quality and consistency, enforcing a set of coding standards and identifying potential errors.
